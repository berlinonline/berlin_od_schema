Berlin Open Data JSON Schema
================

2013 - 2019, Knud MÃ¶ller

Schema to describe and validate dataset descriptions for the Berlin Open Data Portal at http://daten.berlin.de. Using JSON Schema v4 (http://json-schema.org). The base schema is the CKAN dataset schema. Its interpretation and the extras are similar to the OGD (Open Government Deutschland) schema defined here: https://github.com/fraunhoferfokus/ogd-metadata.

This repository holds the schema source and code to derive an HTML representation as well as code snippets to be used in applications relating to the schema.

The current official schema is found at https://datenregister.berlin.de/schema.
